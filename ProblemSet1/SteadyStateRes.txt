__Steady State__
Speedup & Efficiency:

Absolute speedup Sn = Ts/Tp(n)
	Ts - serial time
	Tp(n) - parallel time for n threads

4 samples for 1, 2, 4, & 8 threads:
Tp1(n) = [0.558905,0.507513,0.803342, 0.893959 ]
Tp2(n) = [0.559027,0.508803, 0.794545, 0.874568 ]
Tp3(n) = [0.559485,0.508036, 0.784764 , 0.885903 ]
Tp4(n) = [0.559024,0.507715, 0.789364 , 0.899046 ]
Absolute efficiency En = Sn/n
Ts = 0.526336
Relative Speedup Ts -> Tp(n=1)
Tp(n=1) = 0.559188
